# Tic-Tac-Toe-QL
Thank you for downloading this code 🙏
This is a python program about Tic Tac Toe using Q-learning. This program didn't use machine learning modules and many advanced python code.
The q_tables are already trained, you can download them and skip the training loop or just train the agent again. You can also modify the EPISODES to change the training step.
The program is easy to read and beginner friendly (because I am a beginner 😊)
